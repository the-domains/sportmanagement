There's a lot of buzz about virtual reality nowadays. We all know that it can be used within different domains.

With Oculus, Facebook is looking to expand networks to virtual reality spaces. They announced that you can experience games, videos and more with friends in VR[https://www.oculus.com/en-us/blog/join-friends-in-vr-with-new-oculus-social-features/][0]

It will be possible to connect a Facebook account with Oculus video and personalize the 360 video feed. And in the coming weeks liking and sharing Facebook 360 videos within VR won't be a problem.

Some people are already looking for ways to make money. Immserv is a startup launching a platform to bring ads to VR.

We're still in the early days. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg said that 'the technology remains a long way from reaching the mass market'. He believes that it will take at least 10 years.

Quite curious to hear your opinion about VR and if you're a fan or not? Will marketers need to look at ways to integrate VR in their strategy, starting with 360 video content? And are ads in VR a good idea?
